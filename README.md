# DoclicAddons

DoclicAddons is a Minecraft Forge mod developed by Doclic with some utilities for Hypixel Skyblock.

## Features:
  - NBT viewer
  - /light command to enable full brightness
  - A WIP Auction Bot
  - A Packet Disabler (To imitate unplugging your Ethernet cable or disabling Wi-Fi)
  - Scrollable Tooltips
  - A /packetviewer commands that sends all incoming and outgoing Packets in chat
  
## Archival
I lost interest in making Forge mods, and Hypixel Skyblock  
The released version of the mod should still work forever though  
  
You are free to fork this repo if you want to update this mod yourself
